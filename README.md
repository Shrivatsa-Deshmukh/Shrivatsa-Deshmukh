I trained as an engineer and a physicist — one taught me to build, the other taught me to model. Both kept pointing me toward the same question: *how does a complex system produce intelligent behavior?*

That question pulled me through biomechanics and medical robotics, and eventually to the thing I couldn't stop thinking about — the brain.

**What I work on:**

→ Neural data analysis & computational modeling across scales — single neurons to whole-brain dynamics

→ Statistical and Bayesian tools to decode how the brain encodes, adapts, and breaks down

→ Neurological and psychiatric disorders through a rigorous computational lens

**Where I'm headed:**

→ Building depth in computational neuroscience

→ NeuroAI eventually — because the path there runs through actually understanding the brain, not just borrowing its metaphors
